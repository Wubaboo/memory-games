# Memory Games

I have some family members that suffer from Alzheimer's. This is my attempt at combatting it.

## Games

- Remembering numbers in increasing order
- Matching pairs of pictures
- Recreating a mosaic

## other ideas

- memorizing playing cards
- memorizing strings of numbers
- memorizing words
- memorizing scenes (what's changed in the picture?)
- navigating a minefield
- reconstruct the edges between nodes in a graph
- memorizing a schedule
- maybe something to do with audio?
