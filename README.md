I have some family members who suffer from Alzheimer's. This is my attempt at combatting it.

- memorizing words
- memorizing scenes (what's changed in the picture?)
- reconstruct the edges between nodes in a graph
- memorizing a schedule
- maybe something to do with audio?
- mario party style - fruits crossing the screen and questions about the counts of fruits asked afterwards
- memorizing customer's food orders
